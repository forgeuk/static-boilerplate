# Static Boilerplate

An [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server running a static website built with [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) and [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/).

## Installation

You will need Node.js and Yarn to work with this boilerplate. Run the command `yarn install` to get the required dependencies installed.

To view the static website, run the command `yarn start`. The files will be available to view at http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

## Creating Pages

In the `views/` directory, create a new `.hbs` file. It will be accessible in-browser via the filename you gave.

For example, `views/example.hbs` can be accessed at http://localhost:8080/example.
